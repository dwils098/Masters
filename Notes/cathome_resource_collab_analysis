C@H - Evaluating Resource Collaboration w.r.t. the phases identified in p2p_collab
=====================================================================================
Phase (1), (2) and (3) are somehow accomplished by the Mgmt. Subsystem, thus no
explicit indication pertaining to which strategy they used to achieve this. The
FrontEnd is given the task to collect the user request's and to assimilate them
in a proper fashion the corresponding subsystems. The resource engine is
responsible for the resource management, thus it receive a translated request
from the frontend and it is responsible to look through its centralized index and
find the most appropriate selection of resources.

Phase (4) and (5) seems to be accomplished by the Resource Subsystem, more
precisely th VM Scheduler is reponsible
